IE PNG Transparency Fix
=======================

OK, I know this is yet another png fix thingy but I wasn't too happy with the others 
that were riding on jQuery due to the fact there was a bit too much code for my liking.

The idea with this one is to keep it simple and as slim as possible. I'm still trying 
to slim this down! :)

I'm not doing any detection of whether the image element or CSS background ends with a 
".png" or "-trans.png" etc. That I think is the responsibility of the developer using 
the plugin. it's easy to target specific elements containing PNG's in a document with jQuery.

NOTE: The spacer image I'm using is loaded directly from http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spacer.gif

If anyone knows of a spacer on a reliable CDN I'd like to know. :)

Enjoy!
