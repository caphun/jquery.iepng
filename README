IE PNG Transparency Fix
=======================

OK, I know this is yet another png fix thingy but I wasn't too happy with the others 
that were hiding on jQuery due to the fact there was a bit too much code for my liking.

The idea with this one is to keep it simple and as slim as possible. I'm still trying 
to slim this down. :)

I'm not doing any detection of whether the image element or css background ends with a 
.png or whether it's -trans.png. That I think is a decision the developer using this
plugin should make and is easy to target specific PNG's in a document with jQuery.

NOTE: The spacer image I'm using is loaded directly from

If anyone know's of a spacer on a reliable CDN I'd like to know. :)

Enjoy!
